Description: An implementation of three two-census methods to the estimate the degree of death registration coverage for a population. These include the Generalized Growth Balance method (GGB), the Synthetic Extinct Generation method (SEG), and a hybrid of the two, GGB-SEG. Methods produce automatic estimation, but users may also specify exact parameters or use a graphical interface if desired.
